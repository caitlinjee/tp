**Wishful Shrinking is a desktop application for managing your diet, keeping track of your on-hand ingredients, recipes, as well as the food youâ€™ve eaten (along with their calories).** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Wishful Shrinking, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Wishful Shrinking, the [**Developer Guide**](https://ay2021s1-cs2103t-w10-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
